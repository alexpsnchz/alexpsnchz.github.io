        My research covers several interesting topics:

          (1) Photoswitches and COX-2: Investigating the mechanisms of photoswitches that can target COX-2, a protein linked to inflammation and cancer.
          (2) Human COX-2 Dimer: Exploring the potential of the human COX-2 dimer as a new target for cancer therapy.
          (3) Allosteric Studies of Lipoxygenases (ALOX12 and ALOX15): Using QM/MM studies to examine the reactivity and control of lipoxygenases ALOX12 and ALOX15 through allosteric binding sites.
          (4) Inflammation-related Receptors: Focusing on LGR6 and EP4 receptors to understand their roles and therapeutic potential in inflammation.

        These projects allow me to explore how these molecules work and how they could be used in future drug treatments.
